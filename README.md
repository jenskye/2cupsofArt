> ABOUT MySELF

- Jen here trying to start a new life in coding. Starting my first coded website and will see how this goes. 
I grew up in the province of Iloilo Philippines and I am previledge to experience a simple yet fun childhood. I am sourounded with friends, families, mountains, trees and ricefields. Rivers, falls and the abundant paradise Ocean and beaches of the Philippines. Whenever I live in the city, I miss the primitive life and scenery. This is how my I started scribling, drawing and painting. From the Panda Ballpens in Highschool, to Pilot pens in College to pastels, charcoal and paintbrushes that I am fortunate to afford after years of working as an IT person. Life has been busy with family and work but my passion for art still wakes my artistic hands once in a while. I am a mother of a 10 year old artist herself.
